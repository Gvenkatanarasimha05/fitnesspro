itnessPro – A Fitness Trainer & Member Portal
🔍 Overview:
FitnessPro is a web-based platform designed to help fitness trainers and gym members interact through a structured system. It allows trainers to showcase themselves and users to register, log in, and upload content or details related to their fitness journey. This can be used as a mini CMS (Content Management System) for fitness professionals or as a basic social portal for a gym/fitness club.

Session Management
The platform uses sessions (via express-session and connect-mongo) to maintain user login states securely.
